# Beginner-Ciphers

***THESE PROGRAMS NEED TO BE EDITED FOR BETTER CLARITY AND USABILITY***

This project is a set of python programs that include the following ciphers:<br>
1. Prints ASCII value of the letters in a word along with character count.<br>
2. Encrypt using Caesar Shift Cipher. <br>
3. Decrypt a Caesar Shift Cipher without key. <br>
4. Encrypt a plain text using one to one mapping. <br>
5. Decrypt a cipher text using one to one mapping. <br>
6. Create a key matrix for PlayFair Cipher. <br>
7. Encrypt a plain text using PlayFair Cipher. <br>
8. Decrypt a cipher text using PlayFair Cipher. <br>
9. Encrypt and Decrypt text using Hill Cipher. <br>
10. Encrypt and Decrypt text using Vigen√®re Cipher. <br>
11. Encrypt a plain text using Row(Columnar) Transposition. <br>
12. Decrypt a cipher text using Row(Columnar) Transposition. <br><br>
